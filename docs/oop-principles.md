Topics:

    *Encapsulation
    *Abstraction
    *Inheritance
    *Polymorphism

## III. Polymorphism

### 1. what is Polymorphism?

* Polymorphism means “many forms.”

>In object-oriented programming, polymorphism is the provision of one interface to entities of different data types.[^1]

>Basically, Same method name → different behavior.

**Polymorphism helps write flexible code, reduce duplication, and make code easier to extend and maintain**

### 2. Steps to polymorphism

1. Create a contract (Interface / abstract class)
2. Create Classes That Follow the Contract
3. Create Objects Using the Contract Type
